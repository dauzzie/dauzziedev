## Technologies I Learned in 2021

 * [x] **Angular** - used it but doesn't feel like it is super flexible with other wares

 * [x] **C# + Unity** - had a really fun time using these technologies, Unity is still quite buggy and lack documentation

 * [ ] **Apollo GraphQL** - really good tool, just feels too overwhelming with so many features

 * [x] **PostgreSQL** - best database so far alongside **Mongoose**, both very good options

 * [x] **nextJS** - probably the best front end framework right now, by far. Used it and loved it

 * [x] **Flask** - I don't feel like it is super scalable and organized, but it is very quick to push out production

 * [ ] **tensorflow** - pushed myself to learn but never had the willpower to do so ðŸ˜¢

 * [ ] **Unreal Engine** - also never got the time to dig down this tech

 * [x] **Prisma** - feels really nice, still not sure how it fits the project altogether

 * [x] **mongoDB** - mongoose is the savior for this *kinda* dying tech

 * [ ] **redux** - I probably should learn this state management system but never got around to learn it

 * [x] **REST API** - used it with **Postman** and **Insomnia**, the latter good for local dev but not super necessary

 * [x] **MikroORM** - feels a bit clunky and overwhelmed when used. Might give it a try again?


## Technologies I Want to Learn in 2022

* **Rust**
* **Flutter**
* **Golang**
* **Kubernetes**
* **Docker**
* **WebSockets/Socket.io**
* **Relay**
* **webRTC**
* **PlanetScale**
* **CMS tools (DatoCMS)**
* **Unreal Engine**
* **Redux**
* **React Native**
* **CloudFlare**
* **urql**
* **Smart contracts**

Hoping that I get to try these technologies and see how I feel
