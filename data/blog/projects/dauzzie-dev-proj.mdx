_Date_ : 2022-01-05

_Time_: 14:12

Learned state management using Recoil, storing session cookies using NextAuth and concept of Debounce by preventing multiple calls to API.

üßê Do I like Recoil so far?
It seems there is still a bug when browser calls Recoil atoms more than once, popping up `Duplicate atom key` errors. It is a bit unstable in that sense.
Until next update!

‚¨Ü Upwards
I want to improve Lighthouse scores by CDN content and improving some renders. There is a blog post about it!
